# Sense HAT Sensors

## Variations

- [Sense HAT sensors](sense-hat-sensors.md)

## Preparation

- Connect the Sense HAT to the Pi before booting up
- Download the `faces.py` file before starting:
    - Open a terminal
    - Enter `wget http://rpf.io/shfaces -O faces.py`

## Notes

- Make sure users start in the IDLE shell, not a new file
- They should not type the chevrons (`>>>`) - this is an indication that they should type into the shell
- On the second step, they should move to a new Python file and save it and run
